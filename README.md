## About

This open-source project was created primarily because of me being unable to register a lihkg account as a high school student.

Currently, it aims to be a fully featured alternative to lihkg. However, I might also add other useful features.

As contrasted with lihkg, metahkg is open to everyone and anyone can create an account with a email address, no matter issued by a university or not.

## Deploying

Please run `git submodule foreach git pull` upon cloning the repository.

See DEPLOY.md.
For a fast setup run ./setup.sh.
